A REST client for the rest of us.

**RESTED** is a new take on REST clients for browsers.

It is designed to be easy to use to let you work as effective as possible.
It features all the most commonly used HTTP methods, setting headers, beautiful themes,
saving requests in your browser, and more.
**RESTED** is built upon all the latest web technologies to make
both the user's and developer's experience as great as possible. _Enjoy!_

**RESTED APS** is a fork of **RESTED** with [APS](http://doc.apsstandard.org/7.2/) features.

Since this is a relatively new project, I am also happy to announce that
it is also awesomely easy to contribute to the project! Everything is
javascript and html using React.js and Redux, so come join! All contributions
welcome.
