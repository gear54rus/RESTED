A REST client for the rest of us.

_Note: This is the source code, the extension download is [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rested-aps/?src=github)._

**RESTED** is a new take on REST clients for browsers.

It is designed to be easy to use to let you work as effective as possible.
It features all the most commonly used HTTP methods, setting headers, beautiful themes,
saving requests in your browser, and more.
**RESTED** is built upon all the latest web technologies to make
both the user's and developer's experience as great as possible. _Enjoy!_
